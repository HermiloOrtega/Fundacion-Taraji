# 🐶 Fundación Taraji

## 🧭 Overview
**Fundación Taraji** is a nonprofit website created to support an animal rescue organization based in Monclova, Mexico. Developed entirely for free as part of a community initiative through the Jucod startup, the website showcases the organization's mission, shares rescue stories, and facilitates contact and donations.

## 💡 Idea & Concept
As part of Jucod’s mission to give back to the community, we launched a campaign to support a nonprofit through full website development. Fundación Taraji was selected due to its compassionate work rescuing stray dogs and advocating for animal welfare.

The primary goals of the site were to:
- Build awareness of the foundation's mission and success stories.
- Provide a clear channel for contact and volunteer opportunities.
- Enable online donations via PayPal and other payment platforms.

## ✨ Features & Functionality
- **Home Page:** Introduces the organization with impactful visuals and mission statement.

- **Stories of Rescue:** Shares real-life cases of rescued dogs with before/after photos.
- **Contact Page:** Includes embedded contact forms and maps for in-person visits.
